# Juliagebra

Geogebra like 3D interactive plotting libary written in Julia and OpenGL.

## Used Packages

Every package used by Juliagebra and the usage examples can be found in the **"pkg_installer.jl"** file.

## Examples

Scripts which showcase the use of the library can be found inside [Tests/Examples/](Tests/Examples/).

## Creating dependents

For how a Non-Rendered/Rendered Dependent can be created, a good place to start is [intersections.jl](Prototype/source/Dependents/intersections.jl) and [point.jl](Prototype/source/Dependents/point.jl).

Highly suggested steps for creating a Dependent:
1. Create a file for it in the [source/Dependents/](Prototype/source/Dependents/) folder.
2. Include the created file in [juliagebra.jl](Prototype/juliagebra.jl) below the **Dependents** section.
3. Additional helper files should go in the [source/Helpers/](Prototype/source/Helpers/) folder.
4. Helper files can be included in [juliagebra.jl](Prototype/juliagebra.jl) below the **Helpers** section, or dierctly above the dependent's include, if nothing else uses it.
5. Create a **Plan**.
6. Create a **Dependent**.
7. If needed create a **Renderer**.
8. Once done, create a User accessible (exported) constructor function in [constructors.jl](Prototype/source/constructors.jl).
9. Create usage examples in [Tests/Examples/](Tests/Examples/).
