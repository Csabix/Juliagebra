# Juliagebra

Geogebra like 3D interactive plotting libary written in Julia and OpenGL.

## Used Packages

Every package used by Juliagebra and the usage examples can be found in the [pkg_installer.jl](pkg_installer.jl) file.

## Examples

Scripts which showcase the use of the library can be found inside [Tests/Examples/](Tests/Examples/).

Camera movement is just like in Blender:
- Look around by holding down the scroll wheel, and moving the mouse.
- Pan the camera by doing the same, but holding down the shift key.
- Scroll to zoom in-and-out.

## Creating dependents

For how a Non-Rendered/Rendered Dependent can be created, a good place to start is [intersections.jl](Prototype/source/Dependents/intersections.jl) and [point.jl](Prototype/source/Dependents/point.jl).

Highly suggested steps for creating a Dependent:
1. Create a file for it in the [source/Dependents/](Prototype/source/Dependents/) folder.
2. Include the created file in [juliagebra.jl](Prototype/juliagebra.jl) below the **Dependents** section.
3. Additional helper files should go in the [source/Helpers/](Prototype/source/Helpers/) folder.
4. Helper files can be included in [juliagebra.jl](Prototype/juliagebra.jl) below the **Helpers** section, or dierctly above the dependent's include, if nothing else uses it.
5. Create a **Plan**.
6. Create a **Dependent**.
7. If needed create a **Renderer**.
8. Once done, create a User accessible (exported) constructor function in [constructors.jl](Prototype/source/constructors.jl).
9. Create usage examples in [Tests/Examples/](Tests/Examples/).

## Hardware Issues

Currently Juliagebra works best, without issues on Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Linux with Xorg GNOME, using NVIDIA GPUs with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers.
Other hardware and software configurations are mostly untested.

### Some known Windows 11 specific issues

- Distant lines can appear fuzzy on AMD GPUs under windows 11.
- Mouse movement feels sluggish, inconsistent, and lumpy.
- Mouse scrolling also feels sluggish, inconsistent, and lumpy.
